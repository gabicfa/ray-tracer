## Overall Idea - Raytracer

I will develop a Ray tracer with the ability to ray-trace primitives such as spheres, planes, cones and meshes. The program will use a simple text file to describe the material properties, lights and objects in the scene. The ray-traced image will either be save to an image file or using the OpenGL framebuffer.
